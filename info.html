        <h6 class="about">We are a group of students in the San Francisco Bay Area.<br>   
            We wanted to be more informed about the pandemic that had drastically changed our lives. <br>
            That inspired us to make this website.<br>
            We hope to keep up with the latest news to the spread of the virus, and local restrictions.
